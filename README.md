### Castle of Sound

This choose-your-own adventure command line game includes a soundtrack that the user can manipulate through moving to different parts of the castle and acquiring various objects. The soundtrack includes music that is generated using algorithms with random components as well as recordings of various ambient noises like footsteps, birds, and background conversation.

Download the soundfiles needed from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GT2uNe9idCnJlRWD0WYllIviSZOjfrqh?usp=sharing) and place in the `soundfiles` directory. Soundfiles are relatively large even when using the most space-efficient .mp3 format. Git's way of storing and transmitting them along with the rest of the repo is way less efficient than simply uploading to a cloud service.

In the early days of computers, people didn't have the same user interfaces that we have today. Instead of a brightly lit multicolored screen, early consumer computers in the 1960s mainly consisted of typing commands directly into a textbox called the Command Line Interface. Previously computers had to be programmed with punch cards.
