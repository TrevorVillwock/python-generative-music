In the early days of computers, people didn't have the same user interfaces that we have today. Instead of a brightly lit multicolored screen, early consumer computers in the 1960s mainly consisted of typing commands directly into a textbox called the Command Line Interface. Previously computers had to be programmed with punch cards.
